# Auto Anouncements

This is a framework for a bot that will automatically send an email to someone along with attached announcements (or any other file) on Saturday night or when you run the script. It can be configured to either send files automatically if you leave the script and computer it's running on and open or configured to send the email when you run the app.

This script is developed for use in churches where the church can get the person who creates there announcements to send them to the church automatically via this script. The destenation email can be changed as well as the email body. You can also set the framework to upload a file to OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox, or with some coding know-how can upload to your own server.

The `/tests` folder contains some of the tests that I have run and their results.

**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!**

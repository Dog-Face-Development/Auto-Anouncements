# Auto Anouncements

This is a framework for a bot that will automatically send an email to someone along with attached announcements (or any other file) on Saturday night or when you run the script. 

This script is developed for use in churches where the church can get the person who creates there announcements to send them to the church automatically via this script.

**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT!**
